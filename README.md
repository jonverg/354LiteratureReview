## Introduction

I have frequently encountered mentions of CUDA, particularly its compatibility with C and C++. This initiated my interest to explore CUDA further and understand its role in integrating low-level languages (such as C/C++) with high-level languages (such as Python) to optimize machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) development. 

In this literature review, I utilized GPT-4o to examine how CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) facilitates this integration, enhancing the performance, flexibility, and scalability of ML and LLM development. We delve into the historical context, key developments, relevant subfields of programming languages (PL), challenges and best practices, and highlight influential researchers and essential resources in the field.
 
## Questions Explored

1. How does integrating CUDA with low-level languages (like C/C++) and high-level languages (like Python) improve the performance, flexibility, and scalability of machine learning and LLM development?
2. What is CUDA, and why is it implemented using C/C++?
3. What are the performance benefits of using CUDA-accelerated C++ code for computational tasks while managing higher-level logic in Python for LLM fine-tuning?
4. What challenges arise when integrating CUDA-based C++ code with Python in deep learning frameworks?
5. Who are the influential researchers who have left their mark on the field?
6. What are some of the most influential research articles, books, software, and libraries related to CUDA integration with low-level and high-level languages in ML development?
